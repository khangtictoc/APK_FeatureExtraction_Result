So he packed his suitcase with a bag of potato chips and a<br>six-pack of Soft Drink and started his journey.<br><br>When he had gone about three blocks, he met an old<br>man. He was sitting in the<br>park, just staring at some pigeons. The boy sat down next to him and opened his<br>suitcase. He was about to take a drink from his Bottle when he noticed that the old man looked hungry, so he offered him some chips. He gratefully accepted it and<br>smiled at him.<br><br>His smile was so pretty that the boy wanted to see it again, so he offered him a<br>soft drink. Again, he smiled at him. The boy was delighted! They sat there all<br>afternoon eating and smiling, but they never said a word...<br><br>As twilight approached, the boy realized how tired he was and he got up to leave;<br>But before he had gone more than a few steps, he turned around, ran back to the old man, and gave him a hug. He gave him his<br>biggest smile ever...<br><br>When the boy opened the door to his own house a short time later, his mother was Surprised by the look of joy on his face. She asked him, \\'What did you do<br>today that made you so happy?\\'<br><br>He replied, \\'I had lunch with God.\\' But before his mother could respond, he added,<br>\\'You know what? He\\'s got the most beautiful smile I\\'ve ever seen!\\'<br><br>Meanwhile, the old man, also radiant with joy, returned to his home. His son was Stunned by the look of peace on his face and he asked, \\'dad, what did you do today that made you so happy?\\'<br><br>He replied \\'I ate potato chips in the park with<br>God.\\' However, before his son responded, he added, \\'You know, he\\'s much younger than I expected.\\'<br><br>Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.

He reached the boarding gate just before it closed. Sweating and out of breath, he scanned his boarding pass at the counter and quickly made his way to the plane.<br><br>Arriving at his seat, he greeted his companions for the next few hours: a middle-aged woman sitting at the window, and a little girl sitting on the aisle seat. After stowing his bag above, he took his place between them.<br><br>After the flight took off, he began a conversation with the little girl. She appeared to be about the same age as his daughter and was busy with her coloring book. He asked her a few usual questions, such as her age (eight), her hobbies (cartoons and drawing), as well as her favorite animal (horses are pretty, but she just loved cats). He found it strange that such a young girl would be traveling alone, but he kept his thoughts to himself and decided to keep an eye on her to make sure she was okay.<br><br>About an hour into the flight, the plane suddenly began experiencing extreme turbulence. The pilot came over the PA system and told everyone to fasten their seat belts and remain calm, as they had encountered rough weather.<br><br>Several times over the next half hour the plane made drastic dips and turns, shaking all the while. Some people began crying, and many\\u2015like the woman in the window seat\\u2015were praying intently. The man was sweating and clenching his seat as tightly as he could, and exclaim \\u201cOh my God!\\u201d with each increasingly violent shake of the plane.<br><br>Meanwhile, the little girl was sitting quietly beside him in her seat. Her coloring book and crayons were put away neatly in the seat pocket in front of her, and her hands were calmly resting on her legs. Incredibly, she didn\\'t seem worried all.<br><br>Then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the turbulence ended. The pilot came on a few minutes later to apologize for the bumpy ride and to announce that they would be landing soon. As the plane began its descent, the man said to the little girl, \\u201cYou are just a little girl, but I have never met a braver person in all my life! Tell me, dear, how is it that you remained so calm while all of us adults were so afraid?\\u201d<br><br>Looking him in the eyes, she said, \\'My father is the pilot, and he\\'s taking me home.\\'<br><br><br><b>Moral of story:</b><br><br>If we recognise the power of faith.....we won\\'t look for miracles.<br><br>May this beautiful story inspire us and brighten our path. <br>\\\\n}\\n,\\n": 1,

He was very happy. One fine day, a crocodile swam up to that tree and told the monkey that he had traveled a long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry. The kind monkey offered him a few rose apples. The crocodile enjoyed them very much and asked the monkey whether he could come again for some more fruit. The generous monkey happily agreed.<br><br>The crocodile returned the next day. And the next. And the next one after that. Soon the two became very good friends. They discussed their lives, their friends and family, like all friends do. The crocodile told the monkey that he had a wife and that they lived on the other side of the river. So the kind monkey offered him some extra rose apples to take home to his wife. The crocodile\\'s wife loved the rose apples and made her husband promise to get her some every day.<br><br>Meanwhile, the friendship between the monkey and the crocodile deepened as they spent more and more time together. The crocodile\\'s wife started getting jealous. She wanted to put an end to this friendship. So she pretended that she could not believe that her husband could be friends with a monkey. Her husband tried to convince her that he and the monkey shared a true friendship. The crocodile\\'s wife thought to herself that if the monkey lived on a diet of rose monkeys, his flesh would be very sweet. So she asked the crocodile to invite the monkey to their house.<br><br>The crocodile was not happy about this. He tried to make the excuse that it would be difficult to get the monkey across the river. But his wife was determined to eat the monkey\\'s flesh. So she thought of a plan. One day, she pretended to be very ill and told the crocodile that the doctor said that she would only recover if she ate a monkey\\'s heart. If her husband wanted to save her life, he must bring her his friend\\'s heart.<br><br>The crocodile was aghast. He was in a dilemma. On the one hand, he loved his friend. On the other, he could not possibly let his wife die. The crocodile\\'s wife threatened him saying that if he did not get her the monkey\\'s heart, she would surely die.<br><br>So the crocodile went to the rose apple tree and invited the monkey to come home to meet his wife. He told the monkey that he could ride across the river on the crocodile\\'s back. The monkey happily agreed. As they reached the middle of the river, the crocodile began to sink. The frightened monkey asked him why he was doing that. The crocodile explained that he would have to kill the monkey to save his wife\\'s life. The clever monkey told him that he would gladly give up his heart to save the life of the crocodile\\'s wife, but he had left his heart behind in the rose apple tree. He asked the crocodile to make haste and turn back so that the monkey could go get his heart from the apple tree. The silly crocodile quickly swam back to the rose apple tree. The monkey scampered up the tree to safety. He told the crocodile to tell his wicked wife that she had married the biggest fool in the world.<br><br><br>Moral: Don\\'t underestimate yourself. There are bigger fools in this world.\\\\n}\\n,\\n{\\n\\t\\title\\ \\t: \\Trust God \\ ,\\n\\t\\story\\ \\t: \\<br>A man just got married and was returning home with his wife. They were crossing a lake in a boat, when suddenly a great storm arose. The man was a warrior, but the woman became very much afraid because it seemed almost hopeless.<br><br>The boat was small and the storm was really huge, and any moment they were going to be drowned. But the man sat silently, calm and quiet, as if nothing was happening.<br><br>The woman was trembling and she said, \\'Are you not afraid ?\\'. This may be our last moment of life! It doesn\\'t seem that we will be able to reach the other shore.\\'<br><br>The man laughed and took the sword out of its sheath, then he brought the naked sword very close to the woman\\'s neck and asked,\\' Are you afraid ?\\'<br><br>She said,\\'If the sword is in your hands, why I should be afraid? I know you love me.\\'. He put the sword back and said, \\'This is my answer.\\' I know God Loves me, and the storm is in His hands.<br><br>\\'So whatsoever is going to happen is going to be good. If we survive, good; if we don\\'t survive, good ,because everything is in His hands and He cannot do anything wrong.\\'<br><br>Moral: Develop Trust.

I now think the parrot is the happiest bird in creation.\\'<br><br>The crow then approached the parrot. The parrot explained, \\'I lived a very happy life until I saw a peacock. I have only two colors, but the peacock has multiple colors.\\'<br>The crow then visited a peacock in the zoo and saw that hundreds of people had gathered to see him. After the people had left, the crow approached the peacock.<br>\\'Dear peacock,\\' the crow said, \\'you are so beautiful. Every day thousands of people come to see you. When people see me, they immediately shoo me away. I think you are the happiest bird on the planet.\\' The peacock replied, \\'I always thought that I was the most beautiful and happy bird on the planet. But because of my beauty, I am entrapped in this zoo. I have examined the zoo very carefully, and I have realized that the crow is the only bird not kept in a cage.

But the little one came back within minutes with perfect map......When he asked how she could do it so quickly, she said, \\'Oh.... Dad, there is a man\\'s face on the other side of the paper..... I made the face perfect to get the map right.\\' She ran outside to play leaving the father surprised.<br><br>MORAL OF THE STORY:<br>There is always the other side to whatever you experience in this world.

She left her work and stopped by the pharmacy to get some medication for her daughter.<br><br>When returning to her car she found she had locked her keys in the car. She was in a hurry to get home to her sick daughter, she didn\\'t know what to do, so she called her home and told the baby sitter what had happened and she did not know what to do.<br><br>The baby sitter told her that her daughter was getting worse. She said, \\'You might find a coat hanger and use that to open the door.\\'<br><br>The woman looked around and found an old rusty coat hanger that had been thrown down on the ground possibly by someone else who at some time or other had locked their keys in their car.<br><br>Then she looked at the hanger and said, \\'I don\\'t know how to use this.\\' So she bowed her head and asked God to send her some help. Within five minutes an old rusty car pulled up, with a dirty, greasy, bearded man who was wearing an old biker skull rag on his head. The woman thought, \\'Great God. This is what you sent to help me????\\'<br><br>But, she was desperate, so she was also very thankful. The man got out of his car and asked her if he could help. She said \\'Yes, my daughter is very sick. I stopped to get her some medication and I locked my keys in my car, I must get home to her. Please, can you use this hanger to unlock my car.\\'<br><br>He said, \\'SURE.\\' He walked over to the car, and in less than one minute the car was opened. She hugged the man and through her tears she said,\\'THANK YOU SO MUCH..... You are a very nice man.\\'<br><br>The man replied, \\'Lady, I am not a nice man. I just got out of prison today. I was in prison for car theft and have only been out for about an hour.\\'<br><br>The woman hugged the man again and with sobbing tears cried out loud..... \\'THANK YOU GOD FOR SENDING ME A PROFESSIONAL!\\'<br><br><br><br>\\'Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.\\' - Mother Teresa\\ \\n}\\n,\\n{\\n\\t\\title\\ \\t: \\A Pound of Butter \\ ,\\n\\t\\story\\ \\t: \\<br>There was a farmer who sold a pound of butter to the baker.<br>One day the baker decided to weigh the butter to see if he was getting a pound and he found that he was not. This angered him and he took the farmer to court.<br><br>The judge asked the farmer if he was using any measure. The farmer replied \\'Your Honor, I am primitive. I don\\'t have a proper measure, but I do have a scale.\\' The judge asked, \\'Then how do you weigh the butter?\\' The farmer replied \\'Your Honor, long before the baker started buying butter from me, I have been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when the baker brings the bread, I put it on the scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it is the baker.\\'<br><br>What is the moral of the story?<br><br>\\' We get back in life what we give to others.\\'<br><br>Whenever you take an action, ask yourself this question: Am I giving fair value for the wages or money I hope to make? Honesty and dishonesty become a habit. Some people practice dishonesty and can lie with a straight face. Others lie so much that they don\\'t even know what the truth is anymore.

One day, when she finished with her work schedule, she went into the meat cold room (Freezer) to inspect something, but in a moment of misfortune, the door closed and she was locked inside with no help in sight.<br>Although she screamed and knocked with all her might, her cries went unheard as no one could hear her. Most of the workers had already gone, and outside the cold room it\\'s impossible to hear what was going on inside.<br>Five hours later, whilst she was at the verge of death, the security guard of the factory eventually opened the door.<br>She was miraculously saved from dying that day.<br>When she later asked the security guard how he had come to open the door, which wasn\\'t his usual work routine.<br><br>His explanation: \\'I\\'ve been working in this factory for 35 years, hundreds of workers come in and out every day, but you\\'re one of the few who greet me in the morning and say goodbye to me every night when leaving after work. Many treat me as if I\\'m invisible.<br>Today, as you reported for work, like all other days, you greeted me in your simple manner \\'Hello\\'. But this evening after working hours, I curiously observed that I had not heard your \\'Bye, see you tomorrow\\u201d.<br>Hence, I decided to check around the factory. I look forward to your \\'hi\\' and \\'bye\\' every day because they remind me that I am someone.<br>By not hearing your farewell today, I knew something had happened. That\\'s why I was searching every where for you.<br>\\\\n}\\n,\\n": 1,

The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn\\'t worth it to retrieve the donkey.<br><br>He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone\\'s amazement he quieted down.<br><br>A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.<br><br>As the farmer\\'s neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off!<br><br>MORAL : Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a steppingstone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.<br><br>Remember the five simple rules to be happy:<br>1. Free your heart from hatred - Forgive.<br>2. Free your mind from worries - Most never happens.<br>3. Live simply and appreciate what you have.<br>4. Give more.<br>5. Expect less from people but more from God. \\\\n}\\n,\\n{\\n\\t\\title\\ \\t: \\The Carpenter\\ ,\\n\\t\\story\\ \\t: \\A highly skilled carpenter who had grown old was ready to retire. He told his employer-contractor of his plans to leave the house building business and live a more leisurely life with his family. He would miss the paycheck, but he needed to retire.<br><br>The employer was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favor. The carpenter agreed to this proposal but made sure that this will be his last project. Being in a mood to retire, the carpenter was not paying much attention to building this house. His heart was not in his work. He resorted to poor workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end his career.<br><br>When the job was done, the carpenter called his employer and showed him the house. The employer handed over some papers and the front door key to the carpenter and said \\'This is your house, my gift to you.\\'<br><br>The carpenter was in a shock! What a shame! If he had only known that he was building his own house, he would have made it better than any other house that he ever built!<br><br>Our situation can be compared to this carpenter. God has sent us to this world to build our homes in paradise by obeying His commands. Now, we have to decide how well we wish to build the homes where we will live forever. \\ \\n}\\n,\\n": 1,

He turned to his disciples smiled \\'n asked. \\'Why do people shout in anger shout at each other?\\'<br><br>Disciples thought for a while, one of them said, \\'Because we lose our calm, we shout.\\' \\'But, why should you shout when the other person is just next to you? You can as well tell him what you have to say in a soft manner.\\' asked the saint.<br><br>Disciples gave some other answers but none satisfied the other disciples.<br><br>Finally the saint explained, . \\'When two people are angry at each other, their hearts distance a lot. To cover that distance they must shout to be able to hear each other.<br><br>The angrier they are, the stronger they will have to shout to hear each other to cover that great distance.<br><br><br><br>What happens when two people fall in love? They don\\'t shout at each other but talk softly, Because their hearts are very close. The distance between them is either nonexistent or very small...\\' The saint continued, \\'When they love each other even more, what happens? They do not speak, only whisper \\'n they get even closer to each other in their love.<br><br>Finally they even need not whisper, they only look at each other \\'n that\\'s all. That is how close two people are when they love each other.\\'<br><br>He looked at his disciples and said. \\'So when you argue do not let your hearts get distant, Do not say words that distance each other more, Or else there will come a day when the distance is so great that you will not find the path to return.\\' \\\\n}\\n,\\n{\\n\\t\\title\\ \\t: \\How long it would take \\ ,\\n\\t\\story\\ \\t: \\One day a man who had been to gather his coconuts loaded his horse heavily with the fruit.

He went out into the forest and walked a long distance, until finally he came to a big stone and said: \\'Stone, open your mouth and eat me.\\' And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy.<br><br>When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere, hoping to find him. Finally she passed near the stone and it cried out: \\'Here he is.\\' Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not, so she called the horses to come and help her. They came and kicked it, but it would not break. Then she called the carabao and they hooked it, but they only broke their horns. She called the chickens, which pecked it, and the thunder, which shook it, but nothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy. \\\\n}\\n,\\n": 1,

He was young and handsome but he had no friends.<br><br>One day, he saw a beautiful she-hawk sitting on a tree and wanted to marry her but the she-hawk refused to marry him, as he had no friends.<br><br>\\'Will you marry me if I make three friends?\\' \\u2013 he asked. She said that she definitely would.<br><br>The hawk then went looking for friends. While flying on the other bank of the river, he saw a huge tortoise. The hawk flew down to him and said, \\'Dear tortoise, will you be my friend and help me in my hour of need?\\' The tortoise agreed to become his friend and said, \\'Call me whenever you need me and I shall come to your side.\\'<br><br>The hawk also promised him his help at any time and then flew in search of the second friend. Soon, he came upon an osprey. The hawk went to it and asked her if she would be his friend and help him in time of his need. The osprey very gladly accepted his friendship and offered her help whenever he needed it.<br><br>The hawk was glad that he had made two friends.<br><br>He went on searching for a third friend. He flew over the jungle and saw a tiger. Fearless as he was, he went near the tiger and requested him to be his friend. The tiger readily accepted his friendship and said, \\'From now onwards, I am your friend. Nobody will harm you. If anyone tries to harm you, call me and I will be there to help you.\\'<br><br>The hawk was very happy. He thanked the tiger, flew back to the she-hawk and said, \\'I have made three friends, a tortoise, an osprey and a tiger. Will you marry me now?\\'<br><br>The she-hawk agreed to marry him. Soon, their marriage took place. The three friends attended the hawk\\u2019s marriage.<br><br>After some-months, she-hawk gave birth to two baby hawks. The parent hawks were very happy to have cute little babies. They lived happily in their nest.<br><br>One day, two hunters came and sat under that tree. They were tired and hungry. They had not been able to hunt any animal. They decided to catch some fish. But, they couldn\\u2019t catch even a single fish.<br><br>It was getting dark and the hunters decided to spend the night under that tree. To keep themselves warm, they lit a fire. The fire soared high. The hawk-babies on the tree could not bear the heat and the smoke coming out of the fire. They started crying. The Hunters heard their cries. One of them said, \\'There are birds on this tree. Let us catch them. We shall roast them on the fire and eat them.\\' The other one agreed.<br><br>The hawks heard them and were really worried about the safety of their babies. The she-hawk suggested that they seek help from their friends. The hawk went to the osprey and told her his problem. The osprey said, \\'Go home and protect your babies. I shall tackle with the hunters.\\'<br><br>The osprey dived into the river and then flew over the fire. The water from her wet feathers fell on the fire. She repeatedly dived into the river and flew over the fire. The water from her feathers put off the fire.<br><br>The hunters decided to light the fire again; however, as soon as they lit the fire, again the osprey put it off.<br><br>In the meantime, the hawk went to get help from the tortoise. When the tortoise heard about the hawk\\u2019s problem, he said to him, \\'Do not worry dear friend, I will be there in no time and tackle the hunters in my own way. Go and protect your family.\\'<br><br>The hawk flew to the tree and the tortoise reached the tree. He went quite close to where the hunters were sitting and trying to light the fire again. The hunters saw the tortoise and one of them said, \\'Look there is a huge tortoise. Let\\u2019s forget about the hawks and catch this tortoise.\\'<br><br>The other hunter agreed and said, \\'Let\\u2019s tear our shirts and make a rope. We shall tie its one end to the tortoise and other to our waists. Then we will pull the tortoise with all our strength.\\' The other hunter liked the idea. Soon, they make a rope out of their shirts. They tied one end of the rope to the tortoise\\u2019s legs. Then, trying the other end to their waist, they could not pull the tortoise. The tortoise\\u2019s strength was much greater than the two hunters were together.<br><br>The tortoise pulled the two men into the water. Once, inside the water, it was very easy for the tortoise to drag them. With great efforts, they cut the rope that was tied to their waist and swam back to the bank. They were now feeling very cold. They had lost their shirts. They thought of making a fire again.<br><br>Seeing them collecting leaves and twigs, the hawk was worried again. He flew to the forest and called his third friend, the tiger. He found the tiger at the edge of the forest. When the tiger heard the hawk\\u2019s problem, he immediately rushed towards the riverbank.<br><br>The hunter had now lighted the fire and one of them was preparing to climb the tree to get the hawk babies. Just then, the tiger reached the tree. Seeing the tiger, the hunters ran from there and never came back again.<br><br>The hawk thanked all his three friends for their kind and timely help. He also realized that it is very important to have at least a few friends. The female-hawk was very wise in advising the hawk to make friends before marrying him.\\\\n}\\n,\\n{\\n\\t\\title\\ \\t: \\Real cost\\,\\n\\t\\story\\ \\t: \\A 6 yr old boy was in the market with his 4 yr old sister.<br>Suddenly the boy found that his sister was lagging behind.<br>He stopped and looked back.<br>His sister was standing in front of a toy shop and was watching something with great interest.<br><br>The boy went back to her and asked,<br>\\'Do you want something?\\'<br><br>The sister pointed at a doll.<br>The boy held her hand and <br>like a responsible elder brother,<br>gave that doll to her.<br><br>The sister was very very happy.<br><br>The shopkeeper watched this and was amused to see the mature behaviour of the boy.<br>Then the boy came to the counter and asked the shopkeeper,<br><br>\\'What is the cost of this doll, Sir!\\'<br><br>The shopkeeper was a cool man<br>and had experienced the odds of life.<br><br>So he asked the boy with a lot of love and affection,<br>\\' Well, What can you pay?\\'<br><br>The boy took out all the shells<br>that he had collected from the sea shore,<br>from his pocket and gave them to the shopkeeper.<br>The shopkeeper took the shells<br>and started counting as if he were counting currency.<br><br>Then he looked at the boy.<br>The boy asked him worriedly,<br>\\'Is it less?\\'<br>The shopkeeper said, <br>\\'No,No..<br>These are more than the cost.<br>So I will return the remaining.\\'<br><br>Saying so,<br>he kept only 4 shells with him and returned the remaining.<br><br>The boy,<br>very happily kept those shells back in his pocket and left with his sister.<br><br>A servant in that shop was very surprised watching all these.<br><br>He asked his master,<br>\\'Sir..!

In the middle of the room is a ladder, leading to a bunch of bananas hanging from a hook on the ceiling.<br><br>Each time a monkey tries to climb the ladder, all the monkeys are sprayed with ice water, which makes them miserable. Soon enough, whenever a monkey attempts to climb the ladder, all of the other monkeys, not wanting to be sprayed, set upon him and beat him up. Soon, none of the eight monkeys ever attempts to climb the ladder.<br><br>One of the original monkeys is then removed, and a new monkey is put in the room. Seeing the bananas and the ladder, he wonders why none of the other monkeys are doing the obvious. But undaunted, he immediately begins to climb the ladder.<br><br>All the other monkeys fall upon him and beat him silly. He has no idea why.<br><br>However, he no longer attempts to climb the ladder.<br><br>A second original monkey is removed and replaced. The newcomer again attempts to climb the ladder, but all the other monkeys hammer the crap out of him.<br><br>This includes the previous new monkey, who, grateful that he\\u2019s not on the receiving end this time, participates in the beating because all the other monkeys are doing it. However, he has no idea why he\\u2019s attacking the new monkey.<br><br>One by one, all the original monkeys are replaced. Eight new monkeys are now in the room. None of them have ever been sprayed by ice water. None of them attempt to climb the ladder.

There is a nine-year-old kid sitting at his desk and all of a sudden, there is a puddle between his feet and the front of his pants are wet. He thinks his heart is going to stop because he cannot possibly imagine how this has happened. It\\'s never happened before, and he knows that when the boys find out he will never hear the end of it. When the girls find out, they\\'ll never speak to him again as long as he lives. The boy believes his heart is going to stop; he puts his head down and prays this prayer, \\'Dear God, this is an emergency! I need help now! Five minutes from now I\\'m dead meat.\\'<br><br>He looks up from his prayer and here comes the teacher with a look in her eyes that says he has been discovered. As the teacher is walking toward him, a classmate named Susie is carrying a goldfish bowl that is filled with water. Susie trips in front of the teacher and inexplicably dumps the bowl of water in the boy\\' s lap. The boy pretends to be angry, but all the while is saying to himself, \\'Thank you, Lord! Thank you, Lord!\\'<br><br>Now all of a sudden, instead of being the object of ridicule, the boy is the object of sympathy. The teacher rushes him downstairs and gives him gym shorts to put on while his pants dry out. All the other children are on their hands and knees cleaning up around his desk. The sympathy is wonderful. But as life would have it, the ridicule that should have been his has been transferred to someone else - Susie. She tries to help, but they tell her to get out. You\\'ve done enough, you Clumsy girl!\\'<br><br>Finally, at the end of the day, as they are waiting for the bus, the boy walks over to Susie and whispers, \\'You did that on purpose, didn\\'t you?\\' Susie whispers back, \\'I wet my pants once too.\\'<br>May God help us see the opportunities that are always around us to do good.. Remember.....Just going to a place of worship doesn\\'t make you a good person any more than standing in your garage makes you a car. <br><br>Each and everyone one of us is going through tough times right now, but God is getting ready to bless you in a way that only He can.

They Agreed On A Route And Started Off The Race. The Hare Shot Ahead And Ran Briskly For Some Time. Then Seeing That He Was Far Ahead<br>Of The Tortoise, He Thought He\\'d Sit Under A Tree For Some Time And Relax Before Continuing The Race. He Sat Under The Tree And Soon Fell Asleep. The Tortoise Plodding On Overtook Him And<br>Soon Finished The Race, Emerging As The Undisputed Champ. The Hare Woke Up And Realised That He\\'d Lost The Race.<br><br>The Moral Of The Story Is That Slow And Steady Wins The Race. This Is The Version Of The Story That We\\'ve All Grown Up With.<br><br>But Then Recently, Someone Told Me A More Interesting Version Of This Story.<br><br>It Continues :<br><br>The Hare Was Disappointed At Losing The Race And He Did Some Soul-Searching. He Realised That He\\'d Lost The Race Only Because He Had Been Overconfident, Careless And Lax. If He Had Not Taken Things For Granted, There\\'s No Way The Tortoise Could Have Beaten Him. So He Challenged The Tortoise To Another Race. The Tortoise Agreed. This Time, The Hare Went All Out And Ran Without Stopping From Start To Finish. He Won By Several Miles.<br><br>The Moral Of The Story?<br>Fast And Consistent Will Always Beat The Slow And Steady. If You Have Two People In Your Organisation, One Slow, Methodical And Reliable, And The Other Fast And Still Reliable At What He Does, The Fast And Reliable Chap Will Consistently Climb The Organisational Ladder Faster Than The Slow, Methodical Chap. It\\'s Good To Be Slow And Steady; But It\\'s Better To Be Fast And Reliable.<br><br>But The Story Doesn\\'t End Here. The Tortoise Did Some Thinking This Time, And Realised That There\\'s No Way He Can Beat The Hare In A Race The Way It Was Currently Formatted. He Thought For A While, And Then Challenged The Hare To Another Race, But On A Slightly Different Route. The Hare Agreed.<br><br>They Started Off. In Keeping With His Self-Made Commitment To Be Consistently Fast, The Hare Took Off And Ran At Top Speed Until He Came To A Broad River. The Finishing Line Was A Couple Of<br>Kilometres On The Other Side Of The River. The Hare Sat There Wondering What To Do. In The Meantime The Tortoise Trundled Along, Got Into The River, Swam To The Opposite Bank, Continued Walking And Finished The Race.<br><br>The Moral Of The Story?<br>First Identify Your Core Competency And Then Change The Playing Field To Suit Your Core Competency. In An Organisation, If You Are A Good Speaker,Make Sure You Create Opportunities To Give<br>Presentations That Enable The Senior Management To Notice You.<br><br>If Your Strength Is Analysis, Make Sure You Do Some Sort Of Research, Make A Report And Send It Upstairs. Working To Your Strengths Will Not Only Get You Noticed, But Will Also Create Opportunities For Growth And Advancement.<br><br>The Story Still Hasn\\'t Ended. The Hare And The Tortoise, By This Time, Had Become Pretty Good Friends And They Did Some Thinking Together. Both Realised That The Last Race Could Have Been Run<br>Much Better.<br><br>So They Decided To Do The Last Race Again, But To Run As A Team This Time. They Started Off, And This Time The Hare Carried The Tortoise Till The Riverbank.There, The Tortoise Took Over And Swam<br>Across With The Hare On His Back. On The Opposite Bank, The Hare Again Carried The Tortoise And They Reached The Finishing Line Together. They Both Felt A Greater Sense Of Satisfaction Than They\\'d Felt Earlier.<br><br>The Moral Of The Story?<br>It\\'s Good To Be Individually Brilliant And To Have Strong Core Competencies; But Unless You\\'re Able To Work In A Team And Harness Each Other\\'s Core Competencies, You\\'ll Always Perform Below Par Because There Will Always Be Situations At Which You\\'ll Do Poorly And Someone Else Does Well. Teamwork Is Mainly About Situational Leadership, Letting The Person With The Relevant Core<br>Competency For A Situation Take Leadership.<br><br>There Are More Lessons To Be Learnt From This Story. Note That Neither The Hare Nor The Tortoise Gave Up After Failures. The Hare Decided To Work Harder And Put In More Effort After His Failure. The Tortoise Changed His Strategy Because He Was Already Working As Hard As He Could. In Life, When Faced With Failure, Sometimes It Is Appropriate To Work Harder And Put In More Effort. Sometimes It Is Appropriate To Change Strategy And Try Something Different. And Sometimes It Is Appropriate To Do Both.<br><br>The Hare And The Tortoise Also Learnt Another Vital Lesson. When We Stop Competing Against A Rival And Instead Start Competing Against The Situation, We Perform Far Better.\\\\n}\\n,\\n{\\n\\t\\title\\ \\t: \\Be kind, Be compassionate... \\,\\n\\t\\story\\ \\t: \\There was once a young boy who often was angry.<br><br>His father decided to give him a bag of nails one afternoon saying: \\u201cson, when you get angry take one of these nails and simply nail it into the fence in our backyard. You will feel better by releasing your frustration.\\u201d<br><br>After the first day, the young boy had nailed 25 nails into the fence.<br><br>But as the weeks went by, the young boy grew more aware of his anger and put fewer and fewer nails into the fence.<br><br>Although he never denied the anger that was there, in time, he found it easier to silently experience his anger and then release it rather than angrily nail the nails into the fence.<br><br>Finally, the day came when the young boy stopped losing his temper completely. On that day, his father said to him: \\u201cson, now go to that fence and pull out a nail for each day that you could manage your anger and hold it in a responsible way.\\u201d<br><br>A day later, the boy went to his father and told him that each nail had been removed from the fence.<br><br>The father replied: \\u201cI am proud of you son. I would like you to look at the holes that you have made in the fence.\\'<br><br>\\'When things are said in anger, irritation or frustration, you can put a hole into someone just like you have put a hole into that fence.\\'<br><br>\\'Although you may retract your words and apologize, the scar can remain for a long, long time. So be kind. Be compassionate.\\'\\\\n}\\n,\\n": 1,

Every day, a hunchback came and took away the chapatti.<br>Instead of expressing gratitude, he muttered the following words as he went his way:<br><br>\\'#The_Evil_yoU_Do_Remains_with_yoU\\u202c:<br>\\u202a#The_Good_yoU_Do_Comes_Back_to_yoU\\u202c! \\'<br><br>This went on, day after day.<br>Every day, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and uttered the words:<br>\\'The evil you do, remains with you:<br>The good you do, comes back to you!\\'<br><br>The woman felt irritated.<br><br>\\'Not a word of gratitude,\\'<br>she said to herself\\u2026<br><br>\\'Everyday this hunchback utters this jingle! What does he mean?\\'<br><br>One day, exasperated, she decided to do away with him.<br>\\'I shall get rid of this hunchback,\\'<br>she said.<br>And what did she do?<br>She added poison to the chapatti she prepared for him!<br><br>As she was about to keep it on the window sill, her hands trembled. \\'What is this I am doing?\\' she said.<br>Immediately, she threw the chapatti into the fire, prepared another one and kept it on the window sill.<br>As usual, the hunchback came, picked up the chapatti and muttered the words:<br>\\'The evil you do, remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!\\'<br><br>The hunchback proceeded on his way, blissfully unaware of the war raging in the mind of the woman. Every day, as the woman placed the chapatti on the window sill, she offered a prayer for her son who had gone to a distant place to seek his fortune.<br>For many months, she had no news of him.. She prayed for his safe return.<br><br>That evening, there was a knock on the door. As she opened it, she was surprised to find her son standing in the doorway. He had grown thin and lean. His garments were tattered and torn. He was hungry, starved and weak.<br><br>As he saw his mother, he said, \\'Mom, it\\'s a miracle I\\'m here. While I was but a mile away,<br>I was so famished that I collapsed. I would have died, but just then an old hunchback passed by.<br>I begged of him for a morsel of food, and he was kind enough to give me a whole chapatti.<br><br>As he gave it to me, he said,<br>\\'This is what I eat everyday : today, I shall give it to you, for your need is greater than mine!\\'<br><br>\\'As the mother heard those words, her face turned pale.<br>She leaned against the door for support.<br>She remembered the poisoned chapatti that she had made that morning.<br>Had she not burnt it in the fire,<br>it would have been eaten by her own son, and he would have lost his life!<br><br>It was then that she realized the significance of the words:<br><br>\\'The evil you do remains with you: The good you do, comes back to you!\\'<br><br>Moral\\u202c:<br>Do good and Don\\'t ever stop doing good, even if it is not appreciated at that time.<br>If you like this, share it with others and I bet so many lives would be touched .<br>\\\\n}\\n,\\n{\\n\\t\\title\\ \\t: \\Burial of the car \\,\\n\\t\\story\\ \\t: \\One of the richest and most powerful men in Brazil, made waves when he announced plans to bury his million-dollar Bentley, so he could drive around his afterlife in style. He received lots of media attention, mostly negative and was severely criticized for the extravagant gesture and wasting of a precious commodity. Why wouldn\\u2019t he donate the car to charity? How out of touch with reality is this guy? He still went ahead with the ceremony.<br><br>But, there\\u2019s a twist. (Of course there is. Why else would I be covering this story?)<br><br>Moments before lowering the car in the ground prepared for the burial of his Bentley,he declared that he wouldn\\'t bury his car and then revealed his genuine motive for the drama: Just to create awareness for organ donation.<br><br>\\u201cPeople condemn me because I wanted to bury a million dollar Bentley, in fact most people bury something a lot more valuable than my car,\\u201d he said during a speech at the ceremony. \\u201cThey bury hearts, livers, lungs, eyes, kidneys.
