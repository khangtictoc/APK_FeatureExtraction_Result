State of Karnataka, 2000 Cr LJ 262 (Kant).\\n(iii) The establishment of the involvement of the accused in the incident and misgiving of a Barchhi blow to the grandson of the deceased when he tried to go to the rescue of his grand-father, is sufficient to convict the accused under section 300 read with section 34; Banta Singh v. State of Punjab, (1991) Cr LJ 1342 (SC).\\n(iv) The totality of the injuries caused to the victim clearly supports the finding of both the courts below that the accused/appellants went on belabouring the deceased till he died on the spot. In the circumstances, the contention that the ac\\u00adcused did not intend to cause the murder of the deceased cannot be upheld by the Supreme Court; Prabhu v. State of Madhya Pra\\u00addesh, (1991) Cr LJ 1373 (1373-1374) (SC).\\n(v) Where the accused set fire to the single room hut, in which the deceased was sleeping, after locking the door of the room from outside and also prevented the villagers from going to the rescue of the helpless inmate of the room, it was held that the intention of the accused to kill the deceased was clear and they were liable for murder; Rawalpenta Venkalu\\nv. State of Hyderabad, AIR 1956 SC 171.\\n\\u2018And commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death\\u2019\\nMerely causing death, by doing an act with the knowledge that is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability cause death, is not murder. In order that an act, done with such knowledge, should constitute murder, it is necessary that it should be committed without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing the death or bodily injury. An act, done with the knowledge of its consequences, is not prima facie murder, it becomes murder only if it can be positively affirmed that there was no excuse. The requirements of the section are not satisfied by the act of homicide being one of extreme recklessness. It must, in addition, be wholly in inexcusable. When a risk in incurred even a risk of the gravest possible character which must normally result in death, the taking of that risk is not murder unless it was inexcuatble to take it; Emperor v.

State, AIR 1953 MB 61.\\nClause \\u2018thirdly\\u2019 of section 300 distinguished from the second clause of section 299\\nThe difference between the second clause of section 299 and clause \\u2018thirdly\\u2019 of section 300 to one of degree of probability of death resulting from the intended bodily injury. To put it more broadly, it is the degree of probability of death which determines whether a culpable homicide is of the gravest, medium, or lowest degree. The word likely in second clause of section 299 conveys the sense of probable as distinguished from a mere possibility. The words \\u2018bodily injury \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026 sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\\u2019, in clause thirdly of section 300, mean that death will be the most probable result of the injury having regard to the ordinary course of nature; State of Andhra Pradesh v. Rayavarpu Punayya, AIR 1977 SC 45.\\nConsent\\nCircumstantial evidence is not sufficient to convict ac\\u00adcused when possibility of deceased receiving fatal injury by fall cannot be ruled out; State of Rajasthan v. Kamla, (1991) Cr LJ 602 (SC).\\nEssential of murder\\n(i) Having regard to the number of injuries inflicted on the deceased it was not possible to uphold the contention that there was no intention to kill; Prabhu v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1991) Cr LJ 1373 (1373-1374) (SC).\\n(ii) When there was no evidence as to how death came about, evidence relating to charge of murder was held to be insufficient and unacceptable; Kedar Nath v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1991) Cr LJ 989 (SC).\\nException 4: Heat of passion\\nMere sudden quarrel would not entitle the accused to seek for Exception 4 to section 300; Samuthram alias Samudra Rajan v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1997) 2 Crimes 185 (Mad).\\nException 4: Scope and applicability of\\nTo invoke Exception 4 to section 300, four requirements must be satisfied, namely (i) it was a sudden fight; (ii) there was no premeditation; (iii) the act was done in a heat of pas\\u00adsion; and (iv) the assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner\\u2026 The number of wounds caused during the occurrence is not a decisive factor but what is important is that the occurrence must have been sudden and unpremeditated and the offender must have acted in a fit of anger. Of course, the of\\u00adfender must not have taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner. Where, on a sudden quarrel, a person in the heat of the moment picks up a weapon which is handy and causes injuries, one of which proves fatal, he would be entitled to the benefit of this Exception provided he has not acted cruelly; Samuthram alias Samudra Rajan v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1997) 2 Crimes 185 (Mad).\\nFight\\nWhere a mutual conflict develops and there is no reliable and acceptable evidence as to how it started and as to who was the aggressor, it will not be correct to assume private defence for both sides. Such a case will be a case of sudden fight and conflict and has to be dealt with under Exception 4 to section 300 of the Code; Januram v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1997) 2 Crimes 582 (MP).\\nInjuries on vital and non-vital parts of body of the deceased\\nInfliction of the injury on the vital part of the body with the agricultural instrument by the enraged accused in a sudden quarrel\\u2014Held, accused did not cause the injury intentionally; Patel Rasiklal Becharbhai v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1992 SC 1150.\\nInjury which is likely to cause death and injury which is sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death\\n(i) Accused inflicted 18 injuries in the arms and legs of the deceased with a gandasa. None of the injuries was on a vital part of the body of the deceased. The obvious motive was revenge because the deceased\\u2019s son had caused a serious leg injury which resulted in the amputations of the leg of P, the son of appellant. The Court held that one of the injuries inflicted by the appellant was on a vital part of the body of the deceased whom the appellant had no intention to kill, at the same time though he had no intention to kill, the appellant must have known that he was inflicting such bodily injuries as were likely to cause death as a consequence of which death did happen. The appellants conviction for murder was accordingly altered to one for culpable homicide; Kapur Singh v. State of Pepsu, AIR 1956 SC 654.\\n(ii) It was held by the Supreme Court that whether the injury intended by the accused and actually inflicted by him is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death or not, must be determined in each case on the basis of the facts and circumstances. In the instant case, the injury caused was the result of blow with a knife in the stomach which was given with such force that the weapon had penetrated the abdomen and had injured the bowels. According to the doctor the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Therefore, in the absence of any circumstances to show that the injury was caused accidentally or unintentionally, it had to be presumed that the accused had intended to cause the inflicted injury and the condition of cl. (3) of section 300, I.P.C. were satisfied. Conviction under section 302 was upheld; Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1958 SC 465.\\n(iii) The appellant had given six blows with a lathi stick on the head of the deceased, one of which fractured his skull. The deceased died three weeks after the incident. The injury which broke the skull had caused a depression in the brain and death was due to brain hemorrhage. It was held that the accused was liable under section 304 for culpable homicide. The Court held that even though the blows were inflicted by the appellant on the head of the deceased with force, the lathi not being an iron rod and the deceased being a young man strongly built the appellant could not under the circumstances be held to have been actuated with the intention of causing the death of the deceased nor do one could think despite the medical evidence that the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Seeing that he survived for three weeks and looking on the doctor\\u2019s admission that an injury of that kind is not incurable; Inder Singh Bagga Singh v. State of Pepsu, AIR 1955 SC 439.\\nIntention and knowledge\\nIt is fallacious to contend that when death is caused by a single blow, clause thirdly is not attracted and, therefore, it would not amount to murder. The ingredient \\u2018intention\\u2019 in that clause gives clue in a given case whether offence involved is murder or not; Jai Prakash v. State (Delhi Administration), (1991) 1 Crimes 474 (SC).\\nProof of sufficiency of the injury to cause death\\n(i) Where evidence of both eye witnesses reliable and well corroborated by medical and other evidence on record inspires confidence that accused had intention to kill deceased then conviction is liable to be sustained; Robba Ramanna Dora v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 2000 Cr LJ 118 (AP).\\n(ii) Where the ocular evidence is explicit and fully supported by medical evidence and evidence of other witnesses and evidence of witnesses who apprehended the accused after some hours of occurrence with blood stained weapon then absence of proof of motive will not render the entire prosecution case unbelievable, therefore, charge of murder against accused proved beyond all reasonable doubt; Ram Nath Novia v. State of Bihar, 2000 Cr LJ 318 (Pat).\\n(iii) Where the evidence of eye witnesses regarding assault to deceased by accused persons was truthful, reliable and clearly corroborated by medical evidence and common intention of accused persons to commit murder of deceased also proved therefore conviction under section 300/34 is proper; Ratan Debnath v. State of Tripura, 2000 Cr LJ 237 (Gau).\\n(iv) Chain of evidence must be complete with fully established circumstances not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of accused. It should be of conclusive nature; Arvind v. State (Delhi Admn.), 1999 (4) SCC 4861: 1999 (3) JT 554.\\nProvocation must be grave\\nThe test of \\u201cgrave and sudden\\u201d provocation is whether a reasonable man, belonging to the same class of society as the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused was placed would be so provoked as to lose his self-control. (2) In India, words and gestures may also, under certain circumstances, cause grave and sudden provocation to an accused so as to bring his act within the First Exception to section 300. (3) The mental back\\u00adground created by the previous act of the victim may be taken into consideration in ascertaining whether the subsequent act caused grave and sudden provocation for committing the offence; Venkatesan v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1997) 3 Crimes 146 (Mad).\\nReasonable man\\u2019s\\u2014Test\\nThe accused, a naval officer, was charged with the murder of P, a businessman of Bombay, for having illicit intimacy with his wife. On coming to know from his wife about the illicit relationship with the deceased, he went to the ship, took from the stores a semi-automatic revolver and six cartridges on a false pretext, loaded the same, went to the flat of P entered in his bedroom and shot him dead after a heated exchange of words. The court held that the test to be applied is that of the effect of the provocation on a reasonable man; and in applying that test it is of particular importance to consider whether a sufficient interval has elapsed since the receiving of the information which caused the provocation to allow a reasonable man to cool down; K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharasthra, AIR 1962 SC 605.\\nScope\\nIt is now well settled principle of law that if two views are possible, one in favour of the accused and the other adversely against it, the view favouring the accused must be accepted; Raghunath v. State of Haryana, AIR 2003 SC 165.\\nWith the knowledge that he is likely, by such act, to cause death\\n(i) In case of murder in which the conclusion of guilt is drawn by prosecution it must be fully established beyond all reasonable doubt and consistent with the guilt of the accused; S.D. Soni v. State of Gujarat, (1991) Cr LJ 330 (SC).\\n(ii) Legislature had advisedly used the words: \\u201cbodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause death\\u201d. Therefore, from an understanding of the legislative intent of section 300, I.P.C., a culpable homicide becomes murder if the attacker causes an injury which he knows is likely to cause death and, of course, consequent to such injury, the victim should die; State of Rajashtan v.

The High Court took the view that there was nothing wrong in these demands as money was needed by the husband for his personal use and in such a case wife should extend help. Reversing the judgment, the Supreme Court held that demand for dowry is prohibited under the law. That itself was bad enough; Shobha Rani v. Madhukar, AIR 1988 SC 121; see also Prakash Kaur v. Harijinderpal Singh, AIR 1999 Raj 46.\\n(ii) The husband and his parents were greedy people. Their desire for dowry was insatiable. They went on demanding dowry even after two years of marriage, and since the parents of wife could not meet these, they started ill-treating her with a view to coercing her parens to give dowry. The Delhi High Court held that this amounted to cruelty; Adarsh Parkash v. Sarita, AIR 1987 Del 203.\\nDemand for money\\nDemand for money after four years of marriage for a specific purpose, no where related to marriage demand but causing of harassment to deceased wife so much so that she was bound to end her life is sufficient for conviction under section 498A; State of Punjab v. Daljit Singh, 1999 Cr LJ 2723 (P&H).\\nDrunkenness\\nNo doubt drinking is a constituent of culture all over the world, and is almost a cult in certain societies. Yet, even here as elsewhere a habit of excessive drinking is a vice and cannot be considered a reasonable wear and tear of married life. No reasonable person marries to bargain to endure habitual drunkenness, a disgusting conduct. And yet it is not an independent ground of any matrimonial relief in India. But it may constitute treatment with cruelty, if indulged in by a spouse and continued, in spite of remonstrances, by the other. It may cause great anguish and distress to the wife who never suspected what she was bargaining for and may sooner or later find living together not only miserable but unbearable. If it was so, she may leave him and may, apart from cruelty, even complain of constructive desertion; Rita v. Brij Kishore, AIR 1984 Del 291.\\nObject\\nSection 498A was added with a view to punishing husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical view would be counter productive and would act against interests of women and against the object for which the provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent woman from settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XXA; B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana,AIR 2003 SC 1386.\\nSection 498A vis-a-vis section 113 of Evidence Act\\nSection 498A of the Indian Penal Code or section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act has not introduced invidious classification qua the treatment of a married woman by her husband or relatives of her husband vis-a-vis the other offenders. On the other hand, such women form a class apart whom from those who are married more than seven years earlier to the commission of such offence, because, with the passage of time after marriage and birth of children, there are remote chances of treating a married woman with cruelty by her husband or his relatives. Thus, the classification is reasonable and has close nexus with the object sought to be achieved, i.e., eradication of the evil of dowry in the Indian social set-up and to ensure that the married women live with dignity at their matrimonial homes; Krishan Lal v. Union of India, 1994 Cr LJ 3472.\\nUnhappiness between husband and wife\\nWhere the prosecution relied only on incident of unhappiness of deceased with her husband and the allegation was only in form of suggestion, it does not establish criminal offence under either or both of the charges, hence conviction under section 498A is improper; State v. K. Sridhar, 2000 Cr LJ 328 (Kant).\\nWilful Conduct\\nThe allegations against the husband were that he abused and beat his wife, forced her to have a common kitchen with a harijan family, accused her of adultery and of carrying in her womb someone else\\u2019s child, pressurizing her to agree for an abortion, and such other acts. This amounted to a wilful conduct of cruelty towards wife; Rishi Kumar v. State of Haryana, Criminal Appeal No. 335-B of 1985.\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014-\\n1.

Padmanabham Nair, 1999 Cr LJ 3696 (SC).\\nCriminal breach of trust: Meaning and extent\\nIt must be proved that the beneficial interest in the property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed was vested in some person other than the accused, and that the accused held that property on behalf of that person. A relationship is created between the transferor and transferee, whereunder the transferor remains the owner of the property and the transferee has legal custody of the property for the benefit of the transferor himself or transferee has only the custody of the property for the benefit of the transferor himself or someone else. At best, the transferee obtains in the property entrusted to him only special interest limited to claim for his charges in respect of its safe retention, and under no circumstances does he acquire a right to dispose of that property in contravention of the condition of the entrustment; Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. State of Bombay, AIR 1956 SC 575.\\nEntrustment\\nThe word entrusted in the section is very important unless there is entrustment, there can be no offence under the section; Ramaswami Nadar v.

It was established that the accused had an earlier stage solicited or induced minor girl to leave her father\\u2019s protection by conveying or indicating an encouraging suggestion, that he would give her shelter. Holding the accused liable for kidnapping under section 363, the Supreme Court said that the mere circumstances that his act was not the immediate cause of her leaving her parental home or guardian\\u2019s custody would constitute no valid defence and would not absolve him from the offence of kidnapping. The question truly falls for determination on the facts and circumstances of each case; Thakorilal D Vadgama v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1973 SC 2314: (1973) 2 SCC 413.\\nLawful guardian\\nWhere facts indicate that a girl left her father\\u2019s protection, knowing and having capacity to know the full import of what she was doing and voluntarily joined the accused, the offence of kidnapping cannot be said to have been made out; S.

On plain reading of this section the consent of the minor who is taken or enticed is wholly immaterial: it is only the guardian\\u2019s consent which takes the case out of its purview. Nor is it necessary that the taking or enticing must be shown to have been by means of force or fraud. Persuasion by the accused person which creates willingness on the part of the minor to be taken out of the keeping of the lawful guardian would be sufficient to attract the section; Prakash v.

The High Court took the view that there was nothing wrong in these demands as money was needed by the husband for his personal use and in such a case wife should extend help. Reversing the judgment, the Supreme Court held that demand for dowry is prohibited under the law. That itself was bad enough; Shobha Rani v. Madhukar, AIR 1988 SC 121; see also Prakash Kaur v. Harijinderpal Singh, AIR 1999 Raj 46. \\n \\n(ii) The husband and his parents were greedy people. Their desire for dowry was insatiable. They went on demanding dowry even after two years of marriage, and since the parents of wife could not meet these, they started ill-treating her with a view to coercing her parens to give dowry. The Delhi High Court held that this amounted to cruelty; Adarsh Parkash v. Sarita, AIR 1987 Del 203. \\n \\nDemand for money \\n \\nDemand for money after four years of marriage for a specific purpose, no where related to marriage demand but causing of harassment to deceased wife so much so that she was bound to end her life is sufficient for conviction under section 498A; State of Punjab v. Daljit Singh, 1999 Cr LJ 2723 (P&H). \\n \\nDrunkenness \\n \\nNo doubt drinking is a constituent of culture all over the world, and is almost a cult in certain societies. Yet, even here as elsewhere a habit of excessive drinking is a vice and cannot be considered a reasonable wear and tear of married life. No reasonable person marries to bargain to endure habitual drunkenness, a disgusting conduct. And yet it is not an independent ground of any matrimonial relief in India. But it may constitute treatment with cruelty, if indulged in by a spouse and continued, in spite of remonstrances, by the other. It may cause great anguish and distress to the wife who never suspected what she was bargaining for and may sooner or later find living together not only miserable but unbearable. If it was so, she may leave him and may, apart from cruelty, even complain of constructive desertion; Rita v. Brij Kishore, AIR 1984 Del 291. \\n \\nObject \\n \\nSection 498A was added with a view to punishing husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical view would be counter productive and would act against interests of women and against the object for which the provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent woman from settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XXA; B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana,AIR 2003 SC 1386. \\n \\nSection 498A vis-a-vis section 113 of Evidence Act \\n \\nSection 498A of the Indian Penal Code or section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act has not introduced invidious classification qua the treatment of a married woman by her husband or relatives of her husband vis-a-vis the other offenders. On the other hand, such women form a class apart whom from those who are married more than seven years earlier to the commission of such offence, because, with the passage of time after marriage and birth of children, there are remote chances of treating a married woman with cruelty by her husband or his relatives. Thus, the classification is reasonable and has close nexus with the object sought to be achieved, i.e., eradication of the evil of dowry in the Indian social set-up and to ensure that the married women live with dignity at their matrimonial homes; Krishan Lal v. Union of India, 1994 Cr LJ 3472. \\n \\nUnhappiness between husband and wife \\n \\nWhere the prosecution relied only on incident of unhappiness of deceased with her husband and the allegation was only in form of suggestion, it does not establish criminal offence under either or both of the charges, hence conviction under section 498A is improper; State v. K. Sridhar, 2000 Cr LJ 328 (Kant). \\n \\nWilful Conduct \\n \\nThe allegations against the husband were that he abused and beat his wife, forced her to have a common kitchen with a harijan family, accused her of adultery and of carrying in her womb someone else\\u2019s child, pressurizing her to agree for an abortion, and such other acts. This amounted to a wilful conduct of cruelty towards wife; Rishi Kumar v. State of Haryana, Criminal Appeal No. 335-B of 1985. \\n \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014- \\n \\n1. Ins. by Act 46 of 1983, sec. 2 (w.e.f. 25-12-1983).": 1,

Here, if A\\u2019s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z\\u2019s possession without Z\\u2019s consent. A has commit\\u00adted theft as soon as Z\\u2019s dog has begun to follow A.\\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\\n(d) A, being Z\\u2019s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\\u2019s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z\\u2019s consent. A has committed theft.\\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of the warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\\u2019s possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z\\u2019s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.\\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z\\u2019s possession, and if A dishonest\\u00adly removes it, A commits theft.\\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\\u2019s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.\\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\\u2019s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed crimi\\u00adnal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.\\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z re\\u00adtains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z\\u2019s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly.\\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\\u2019s possession without Z\\u2019s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.\\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\\u2019s possession, without Z\\u2019s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.\\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\u2019s library in Z\\u2019s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\u2019s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z\\u2019s implied consent to use Z\\u2019s book. If this was A\\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft.\\n(n) A asks charity from Z\\u2019s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z\\u2019s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A\\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft.\\n(o) A is the paramour of Z\\u2019s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\\u2019s own property, takes that property out of B\\u2019s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.\\nComments\\nIngredients\\nThe delay in hearing of appeal for long period is no cause for not interfering with an order of acquittal which was based on conjectures and surmises, resulting in gross failure of justice; State of Rajasthan v.

Dowry death.\\u2014(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or har\\u00adassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called \\u201cdowry death\\u201d, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.\\nExplanation\\nFor the purpose of this sub-section, \\u201cdowry\\u201d shall have the same meaning as in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).\\n(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprison\\u00adment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life.]\\nCLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCE\\nPunishment\\u2014Imprisonment of not less than 7 years but which may extend to imprisonment for life\\u2014Cognizable\\u2014Non-bailable\\u2014Triable by Court of Session\\u2014Non-compoundable.\\nCOMMENTS\\nApplicability\\nIt was argued that the husband or any of his relative could be guilty of the offence only if he or she directly participated in the actual commission of the offence. This contention was rejected by the Andhra Pradesh High Court. It observed that in its real import, section 304B of the Indian Penal Code would be applicable if cruelty or harassment was inflicted by the husband on any of his relative for, or in connection with demand for dowry, immediately preceding the death by bodily injury or by burning. In short she should have died in abnormal circumstances within seven years of the marriage. In such circumstances the husband or the relative, as the case may be, will be deemed to have caused her death and will be liable to punishment; Vadde Rama Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1990 Cr LJ 1666.\\nBurden of Proof\\nThe prosecution under section 304B of Indian Penal Code cannot escape from the burden of proof that the harassment to cruelty was related to the demand for dowry and such was caused \\u201csoon before her death\\u201d. The word \\u201cdowry\\u201d has to be understood as it is defined in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Thus, there are three occasions related to dowry, i.e., before marriage, at the time of marriage and at an unending period. The customary payment in connection with the birth of child or other ceremonies, are not involved within ambit of \\u201cdowry\\u201d; Satvir Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 2001 SC 2828: (2001) 8 SCC 633.\\nDowry\\n(i) Where the evidence revealed that accused\\u2014husband killed deceased\\u2014wife for not satisfying his dowry demand but nothing on record to show involvement of co-accused in-laws with the offence committed by the accused, co-accused in-laws are not guilty of offence under sections 304B; Patil Paresh Kumar Jayanti Lal v. State of Gujarat, 2000 Cr LJ 223 (Guj).\\n(ii) The parties were married on 24-5-1962. After staying in the matrimonial home for two months, she returned to her parents\\u2019 house and told them that her husband wanted a television set and a fridge. Her father gave her a sum of Rs. 6,000 and she left for the matrimonial home. Her husband again demanded a sum of Rs. 25,000 for purchasing a plot. Thereafter the husband took his wife to her parents\\u2019 home saying that he would not take her back unless a sum of Rs. 25,000 was paid to him. After one year he took her back but he did not give up the demand for Rs. 25,000. Soon thereafter she left for her parents\\u2019 home and came back with a sum of Rs. 15,000 with a promise that the rest of the amount would be paid later on. In her husband\\u2019s home she died of strangulation. The trial court found the accused guilty. The death of the deceased took place within seven years of marriage and persistent demands of dowry were made on her and she died under mysterious circumstances. The trial court framed charge under section 304B. The Supreme Court held that no ground for quashing the charge was made out; Nem Chand v. State of Haryana, (1994) 3 Crimes 608 (SC).\\nEssential ingredients\\nTo attract the provisions of section 304B, one of the main ingredients of the offence which is required to be established is that \\u201csoon before her death\\u201d she was subjected to cruelty and harassment \\u201cin connection with the demand of dowry\\u201d; Prema S. Rao v. Yadla Srinivasa Rao, AIR 2003 SC 11.\\nExpression \\u2018soon before her death\\u2019: meaning of\\nThe expression \\u2018soon before her death\\u2019 used in the substantive section 304B, I.P.C. and section 113B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity text. No definite period has been indicated and the expression \\u2018soon before her death\\u2019 is not defined. The determination of the period which can come within the term \\u2018soon before\\u2019 is left to be determined by the courts, depending upon facts and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression \\u2018soon before would normally imply that the interval should not be much between the concerned cruelty or harassment and the death in question. There must be existence of a proximate and live-link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the concerned death. If alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has become stale enough not to disturb mental equilibrium of the woman concerned, it would be of no consequence; Kaliyaperumal v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 2003 SC 3828. See also Yashoda v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2004) 3 SCC 98.\\nPresumption: Applicability\\n(i) The presumption shall be raised only on proof of the following essentials:\\u2014\\n(1) The question before the court must be whether the accused has committed the dowry death of a woman.\\n(2) The woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his relatives.\\n(3) Such cruelty or harassment was for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry.\\n(4) Such cruelty or harassment was soon before her death.\\nKaliyaperumal v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 2003 SC 3828.\\n(ii) In dowry death cases and in most of such offences direct evidence is hardly available and such cases are usually proved by circumstantial evidence. This section as well as section 113B of the Evidence Act enact a rule of presumption, i.e., if death occurs within seven years of marriage in suspicious circumstances. This may be caused by burns or any other bodily injury. Thus, it is obligatory on the part of the prosecution to show that death occurred within seven years of marriage. If the prosecution would fail to establish that death did not occur within seven years of marriage, this section will not apply; Ratan Lal v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 1994 Cri LJ 1684. See also, N.V. Satyanandam v. Public Prosecutor, AP High Court, AIR 2004 SC 1708.\\nSection 304B and Section 498A \\u2013 Distinction\\nSection 304B is a substantive provision creating a new offence and not merely a provision effecting a change in procedure for trial of a pre-existing substantive offence. As a consequence, accused cannot be tried and punished for the offence of dowry death provided in section 304B with the mini\\u00admum sentence of seven years\\u2019 imprisonment for an act done by them prior to creation of the new offence of dowry death; Soni Dev\\u00adrajbhai Babubhai v. State of Gujarat, 1991 Cr LJ (313) (SC).\\nScope\\n(i) A perusal of section 304B clearly shows that if a married woman dies otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband in connection with demand for dowry, such death shall be called \\u201cdowry death\\u201d and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused the death. The conditions precedent for establishing an offence under this section are as follows:\\n(a) that a married woman had died otherwise than under normal circumstances; (b) such death was within seven years of her marriage; and (c) the prosecution has established that there was cruelty and harassment in connection with demand for dowry soon before her death; Baljit Singh v. State of Haryana, AIR 2004 SC 1714: (2004) 3 SCC 122.\\n(ii) Offence under section 304B of the Indian Penal Code is triable by the Court of Session. It is a cognizable and non-bailable offence. The minimum punishment for the offence is seven years imprisonment which may extend to life imprisonment. Section 304B applies not only when death is caused by her husband or in-laws but also when death occurs unnaturally whoever might have caused it. The section will apply whenever the occurrence of death is preceded by cruelty or harassment by husband or in-laws for dowry and death occurs in unnatural circumstances. It may be emphasised that occurrence of death in such circumstances is enough though death might not have been in fact caused by the husband or in-laws. Thus the intention behind the section is to fasten death on the husband or in-laws though they did not in fact caused the death. Thus a fiction has been created. It is because in these circumstances, the misery and agony created thereby which compels the unfortunate married woman to end her life; Premwati v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1991 Cr LJ 263.\\nUnnatural death\\nIn-laws insisted dowry demands on one married young woman. Ultimately, it appeared that she was done to death and her body was cremated without sending any information to her parents or any relatives. The Supreme Court held that, if it was natural death, there was no need for the appellants to act in such unnatural manner and cremate the body in great and unholy haste without even informing the parents. In the result it was an unnatural death, either homicidal or suicidal. But even assuming that it is a case of suicide even then it would be death which had occurred in unnatural circumstances. Even in such a case, section 304B is attracted and this position is not disputed. Therefore, the prosecution has established that the appellants have committed an offence punishable under section 304B beyond all reasonable doubts; Shanti v. State of Haryana, AIR 1991 SC 1226.\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2013\\n1 Ins. by Act 43 of 1986, sec. 10 (w.e.f. 19-11-1986).\\n": 1,

Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.- When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.\\nCOMMENTS\\nCommon intention\\n(i) The burden lies on prosecution to prove that actual participation of more than one person for commission of criminal act was done in furtherence of common intention at a prior concert; State of Orissa v. Arjun Das, AIR 1999 SC 3229: 1999 (8) SCC 154: 1999 (6) JT 14: 1999 (4) Crimes 78 (SC).\\n(ii) Where the evidence did not establish that particular accused has dealt blow the liability would devolve on others also who were involved with common intention and as such conviction not sustainable; State v. T.K. Sadashivaiah Din Kodimallappa, 1999 (1) CCR 152 (Kant).\\n(iii) When the accused rushed with sword drawn itself showed that he shared the common intention hence liable for conviction under section 300, read with section 34; Abdulla Kunhi v. State of Kerala, AIR 1991 SC 452.\\n(iv) The contention that the appellant was physically not in a position because of the sixty per cent. disability due to polio on his lower limbs, to hold the hand of the deceased cannot be accepted. The fact that the accused held the hand of one of the deceased to facilitate assailants to assault deceased, is said to have shared common intention of committing murder of deceased; Major Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 2003 SC 342.\\nDistinction between \\u2019common intention\\u2019 and \\u2018common object\\u2019\\nA clear distinction is made out between common intention and common object is that common intention denotes action in concert and necessarily postulates the existence of a pre-arranged plan implying a prior meeting of the minds, while common object does not necessarily require proof of prior meeting of minds or pre-concert. Though there is a substantial difference between the two sections namely 34 and 149, they also to some extent overlap and it is a question to be determined on the facts of each case; Chittarmal v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 2003 SC 796.\\nDifference in operation of section 34 and section 149\\n(i) Both sections 149 and 34 deal with a combination of persons who become liable to be punished as sharers in the commission of offences. The non-applicability of section is, therefore, no bar in convicting the accused under substantive section read with section 34 if the evidence discloses commission of an offence in furtherance of the common intention of them all; Nethala Pothura\\u00adju v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (1991) Cr LJ 3133 (SC).\\n(ii) In order to convict a person vicariously liable under section 34 or section 149 it is not necessary to prove that each and everyone of them had indulged in overts acts; Ram Blias Singh v. State of Bihar, (1989) Cr LJ 1782: AIR 1989 SC 1593.\\nIngredients\\n(i) When an offence is sought to be proved only on circumstan\\u00adtial evidence, the allegations of common intention under section 34 normally cannot be established in absence of meeting of mind, the overt act of the accused, by their conduct, by using the weapons by their utterance of words; Santosh Desai v. State of Goa, (1997) 2 Crimes 666 (Bom).\\n(ii) In order to bring a case under section 34 it is not neces\\u00adsary that there must be a prior conspiracy or pre-meditation, the common intention can be formed in the course of occurrence; Hari Om v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (1993) 1 Crimes 294 (SC).\\n(iii) Mere surrender by appellant alongwith accused before police does not show meeting of minds as to bring the case within ambit of section 34; Rangaswami v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1989) Cr LJ 875: AIR 1989 SC 1137.\\n(iv) It has been held that the requirement of statute is sharing the common intention upon being present at the place of occurrence. Mere distancing from the scene cannot absolve the accused; Lallan Bhai v. State of Bihar, AIR 2003 SC 333.\\nParticipation in the Criminal Act\\n(i) To apply section 34, apart from the fact that there should be two or more accused, two factors must be established: (i) common intention, and (ii) participation of accused in the commission of an offence. If common intention is proved but no overt act is attributed to the individual accused, section 34 will be attracted as essentially it involves vicarious liability but if participation of the accused in the crime is proved and common intention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked; Jai Bhagwan v. State of Haryana, AIR 1999 SC 1083.\\n(ii) It requires a pre-arranged plan and pre-supposes prior concert therefore there must be prior meeting of mind. It can also be developed at the spur of moment but there must be pre-arrangement or premeditated concert: Ramashish Yadav v. State of Bihar, 1999 (8) SCC 555: 1999(6) JT 560: 1999 (2) JCC (SC) 471.\\n(iii) If some act is done by the accused person in furtherance of common intention of his co-accused, he is equally liable like his co-accused; State of Punjab v. Fauja Singh, (1997) 3 Crimes 170 (P&H).\\n(iv) In the instant case, there was a long standing enmity between two rival factions in a village, and proceedings under the Criminal Procedure Code were pending against members of both factions. On the day fixed for a hearing in the Magistrate\\u2019s Court in a neighbouring town, members of both factions left their village armed with sticks and lathis. While one faction was waiting on the roadside for a bus, the other faction arrived and a fight ensued in which severe injuries were caused on both sides, as a result of which one man died. The members of the opposite faction were charged and convicted under sections 302/34 I.P.C. It was held that the mere presence of a person armed with a deadly weapon at the spot of a crime does not necessarily make him a participator in a joint crime in every case, because for the purpose of section 34 only such presence makes a man a participant in a joint crime as is established to be with the intention of lending weight to the commission of a joint crime; Jamun v. State of Punjab, AIR 1957 SC 469.\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2013\\n1. Subs. by Act 27 of 1870, sec. 1, for the original section.>\\n": 1,

B dishonestly erases the words \\u201cPay to Z or his order\\u201d, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.\\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.\\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z, and by represent\\u00ading to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.\\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B\\u2019s name without B\\u2019s authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property. A has committed forgery.\\n(k) A without B\\u2019s authority writes a letter and signs it in B\\u2019s name certifying to A\\u2019s character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for serv\\u00adice.\\nExplanation 1\\nA man\\u2019s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\\nIllustrations\\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.\\n(b) A writes the word \\u201caccepted\\u201d on a piece of paper and signs it with Z\\u2019s name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A\\u2019s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.\\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.\\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate of Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the sei\\u00adzure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.\\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A\\u2019s benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before. A was on the point of insolvency. A has commit\\u00adted forgery under the first head of the definition.\\nExplanation 2\\nThe making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.\\nIllustration\\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudu\\u00adlently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it.

The fun was in the nature of having taken a photograph of the loyalist worker with a garland of shoes around his neck. The photograph was neither shown to the complainant nor published. In a prosecution under section 504 against the accused for having insulted the complainant, the submission was made on behalf of the accused that the triviality of the act with a view to befooling a member of the fraternity should operate as a bar to the wrong alleged. The plea was not sustained and it was held that the complainant had been subjected to indignity although the Court took a lenient view of the matter by merely admonishing the accused; Kishori Mohan v. State of Bihar, 1976 Cri LJ 654.\\nPrivate defence: object\\n(i) In judging whether accused has exceeded his right to private defence or not the court has to take into account the weapons used; Madan Mohan Pandey v.

State of Gujarat, 1999 (1) Guj CR 176.\\n(iii) Where the right of private defence is pleaded, the defence must be a reasonable and probable version satisfying the cast that the harm caused by the accused was necessary for either warding off the attack or for forestalling the further reasonable apprehension from the side of the accused. The burden of establishing the plea of self-defence is on the accused and the burden stands discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of that plea on the basis of the material on record; Rizan v. State of Chattisgarh, AIR 2003 SC 976.\\nRight to private defence\\n(i) The accused is not required to prove the plea of private defence of person beyond reasonable manner of doubt. The onus on the accused is only to show that the defence version is probable one which is reflected from the salient features and the circum\\u00adstances in the prosecution case itself; Sawai Ram v. State of Rajasthan, (1997) 2 Crimes 148 (Raj).\\n(ii) Divergent views expressed by court where prosecution failed to explain the injuries sustained by accused in same occurrence.

The essence of a woman\\u2019s modesty is her sex. The culpable intention of the accused is the crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not always decisive. Modesty in this section is an attribute associated with female human beings as a class. It is a virtue which attaches to a female owing to her sex. The act of pulling a woman, removing her saree, coupled with a request for sexual intercourse, is such as would be an outrage to the modesty of a woman; and knowledge, that modesty is likely to be outraged, is sufficient to constitute the offence without any deliberate intention having such outrage alone for its object.

A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.\\nExplanation 3\\nIt is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.\\nIllustrations\\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committed an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.\\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z\\u2019s death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z\\u2019s death. Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence. A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.\\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house, B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\\u2019s instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.\\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z\\u2019s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\\u2019s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A\\u2019s property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.\\nExplanation 4\\nThe abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also as offence.\\nIllustration\\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly insti\\u00adgates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B\\u2019s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.\\nExplanation 5\\nIt is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.\\nIllustration\\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C men\\u00adtioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A\\u2019s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.\\n": 1,

It makes punishable all attempts to commit offences punishable with imprisonment and not only those punishable with death. An attempt is made punishable, because every attempt, although it falls short of success, must create alarm, which by itself is an injury, and the moral guilt of the offender is the same as if he had succeeded. Moral guilt must be united to injury in order to justify punishment. As the injury is not as great as if the act had been committed, only half the punishment is awarded. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin when the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with the intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of the offence. The moment culprit commences to do an act with the necessary intention, he commences his attempt to commit the offence. The word \\u201cattempt\\u201d is not itself defined, and must, therefore, be taken in its ordinary meaning. This is exactly what the provisions of section 511 require; Koppula Venkat Rao v.

It makes punishable all attempts to commit offences punishable with imprisonment and not only those punishable with death. An attempt is made punishable, because every attempt, although it falls short of success, must create alarm, which by itself is an injury, and the moral guilt of the offender is the same as if he had succeeded. Moral guilt must be united to injury in order to justify punishment. As the injury is not as great as if the act had been committed, only half the punishment is awarded. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin when the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with the intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of the offence. The moment culprit commences to do an act with the necessary intention, he commences his attempt to commit the offence. The word \\u201cattempt\\u201d is not itself defined, and must, therefore, be taken in its ordinary meaning. This is exactly what the provisions of section 511 require; Koppula Venkat Rao v.

Hence, the omission to mention section 34 in the charge had only an academic significance, and has not in any way misled the accused; Rawalpenta Venkalu v. State of Hyderabad, AIR 1956 SC 171.\\nImportance of motive\\n(i) In dowry deaths motive for murder exists and what is re\\u00adquired of courts is to examine as to who translated it into action as motive viz., whether individual or family; Ashok Kumar v.

State of Maharashtra, AIR 2003 SC 269.\\n(ii) It is alleged that all the four accused expressed their resentment and held Mrs. Gandhi responsible for operation \\u2018Blue Star\\u2019 at Amritsar. To avenge they entered into a conspiracy to kill Mrs. Gandhi. In pursuance of the aforesaid conspiracy, two accused being security guards, who had prior knowledge that Smt. Gandhi was scheduled to go on the morning of 31st October, 1984 from her residence at Safdar Jang Road to her office at Akbar Road via TMC gate for an interview with Irish Television team, got manipulated their duties in such a way that one of the accused would be present at the TMC gate and another at TMC sentry booth between 7.00 AM to 10.00 AM. While Mrs. Gandhi was approaching to TMC gate towards her office one of the accused fired five rounds and another accused 25 shots at her from their respective weapons. Smt. Gandhi sustained injuries and fell down and succumbed to her injuries same day at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence awarded by the trial Court and maintained by High Court to three appellants for entering into conspiracy and committing murder of leader under sections 302, 120B, 34, 107 and 109 of the Penal Code and held that the murder by the security guards is one of the rarest of rare case in which extreme penalty of death is called for to assassin and his conspirators; Kehar Singh v. Delhi Administration, AIR 1988 SC 1883.\\n(iii) On the night of 21st May, 1991 a diabolical (wicked) crime was committed. It stunned the whole nation. Rajiv Gandhi, former Prime Minister of India, was assassinated by a human bomb. With him 15 persons including a policeman perished and 43 suffered grievous or simple injuries. Assassin Dhanu one of the LTTE activist, who detonated (exploded) the belt bomb concealed under her waist and Haribabu, a photographer (and also a conspirator) engaged to take photographs of the horrific sight, also died in the blast. A camera was found intact on the body of Haribabu at the scene of the crime. Film of the camera when developed led to unfolding of the dastardly act committed by the accused and others. A charge of conspiracy for offences under TADA, I.P.C., Explosive Substances Act, 1908, Arms Act, 1959, Passport Act, 1967, Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933 was laid against 41 persons, 12 of whom were already dead having committed suicide and three absconded.\\nOut of these 26 faced the trial before the Designated Court. Prosecution examined 288 witnesses and produced numerous documents and material objects. The Court found them guilty of the offences charged against them and awarded death sentence to 21 of them on the charge of conspiracy to murder under section 120B read with section 203, I.P.C. The apex Court by a unanimous verdict set at liberty 19 accused for charges under section 120B read with section 302, I.P.C. and confirmed the death sentence awarded by the trial Court. As regards the extreme penalty of death to Nalani was concerned it was confirmed by a majority of 2 to 1. Considering the fact that she belonged to the weaker section and she was led into the conspiracy by players on her feminine sentiments, she became an obedient participant without doing any dominator\\u2019s role. She was persistently brainwashed by A3 who became her husband and then the father of her child and her helplessness in escaping from the cobweb of Sivarasan and company. The mere fact that she became obedient to all the instructions of Sivarasan, need not be used for treating her conduct as amounting to rarest of the rare cases. The President of India commuted the death sentence of Nalani to life imprisonment on humanitarian ground, as she was mother of an infant child; State of Tamil Nadu through Superintendent of Police CBI/SIT v. Nalani, AIR 1999 (5) SC 2640.\\nRelevant factors to ascertain murder\\nThe basic constituent of an offence under section 302, is homicidal death; Sangarabonia Sreenu v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (1997) 4 Supreme 214.\\nSentence \\u2013 General\\nProvisions of death sentence being an alternative punishment for murder is not unreasonable; Bachhan Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1980 SC 898: (1980) 2 SCC 864: (1980) Cr LJ 636 : (1980) Cr LR (SC) 388: 1980 (2) SCJ 475.\\nStrangulation, throttling and hanging cases\\nWhere post mortem report showed that there was ligaltive mark on the neck of the deceased wife which was anti-mortem, the opinion of the doctor was clear and definite that such ligaltive mark of 5 cm width in horizontal position could not be caused by strangulation, the medical evidence, therefore, completely pacified the case of the accused husband that on his return from the field to his house he had found his wife hanging, and thus she had committed suicide; Madhari v.
